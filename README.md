Once you've built your micro-mouse, test it using Jesse Arendse's code 'MicroMouseTemplate' from the Github page [https://github.com/JesseJabezArendse/MicroMouseTemplate](https://github.com/JesseJabezArendse/MicroMouseTemplate).

The main code repository is at [https://github.com/EEEUCT/Micromouse](https://github.com/EEEUCT/Micromouse).

You will need the code from both these repositories to develop the required software and program your micro-mouse.
